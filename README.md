# Computer-Troubleshooting
Alfredo Perez
This is a repository for a final project for programming to IT. This Project is based on a troubleshooting program that helps other users how to fix their computer issues and needs.
To operate the program you have to put your name first and it will start. You may choose which question you want to do first.

if i had enough time, i would have made a code that will ask you if the solution was helpful where if you say yes, it will exit the program and if you say no, it will give you another solution until you're satisfied.
